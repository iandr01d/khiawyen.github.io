<p>Hey There! I am Ian Eng.<!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag -->

<p>I am currently a Mobile Developer for Connected Health Singapore.</p>
<p>I began IRC scripting when I was 10 years old back to the days when mIRC was widely used as a means of communication around the globe. This was my first foray into the realm of computer programming, and through the years that followed, I continued to build on my
skills and aptitude as a programmer of increasingly complex and powerful computer code.</p> <!-- bitlagbitlagbitlagbitlagbitlagbitlag -->
<p>I have worked in fields like Android development, iOS development and Node.js web app development. You can obtain a copy of my resume <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qLhR_FelF9Mx47HJIl6h3u5o7-BFP_dy">here</a>!</p><!-- delaydelaydelaydelaydelaydelaydelay -->
